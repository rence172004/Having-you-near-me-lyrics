                <p>[Verse 1]</p>
                <p>I came to you and never asked too much</br>
                    Wondering what you would say<br>
                    Hoping you'd understand<br>
                    It's not a role I usually play <br>
                    Don't speak to much of what's been going on<br>
                    The past is over and gone<br>
                    Give me your troubled mind <br>
                    You know it's true<br>
                    I can do so much for you<br>
                    I want you<p> 

                        Having you near me<br>
                        Holding you near me<br>
                        I want you to stay and never go away<br>
                        It's so right, having you near me<br>
                        Holding you near me<br>
                        I'll love you tonight, it feels so right<br>
                        Feels so right

                    </p>
